					<h2>Localization</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IF7ElTP.png" style="width:1000px;" alt="Leica Tracking Prism"/>
					<p>Autonomous navigation systems require strong localization systems.  This subsystem dictates the overarching physical structure of our system.  Sticking to the results of Major System Level Trade A, localization should be performed using a multiple beacon or single beacon system.  
					</p>
					<p>According to Subsystem Level Trade A, the system should include one survey gun for absolute localization. With the consideration of Subsystem Level Trade D, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) should also be included.  The combination of these two sensors should allow the robot to position and orient itself within the world.  This technical capability provides the best chance for success in achieving Fieldroidâ€™s functional Requirements
					</p>
					<p>Alternative solutions must be considered and there were clear options presented in the trade studies if problems should arise.  The primary downside of the survey gun is cost.  If this problem seems too hard to overcome, a camera and April tags solution may be the next most feasible option as it minimizes cost.  Also, due to the high importance placed on Functional Requirement 1 & 2, there may be a need to include more additional sensors for validation.  Wheel encoders were close to passing in Subsystem Level Trade D and should be considered if a two sensor solution does not meet the requirements.  
					</p>
					<h2>CPU</h2>
					<p>The type of CPU platform and physical architecture depends on the type of system configuration chosen as mentioned in the Major Systems-Level Trade Studies. This subsystem adds to the reliability of the system accurately painting line markings. The criteria for the CPU consists of high speeds with a strong programming interface and capabilities of communicating to several physical components easily. This aligns with the functional requirements listed for our system.
					</p>
					<p>Based on the results and decisions of Major System-Level Trade A, the Fieldroid system makes use of a single board computer that receives constant localization feedback from a single or multiple beacons. Since the system only needs to react to feedback loops and communicate to various actuators, we need to use a CPU platform that is capable of this. The CPU on-board Fieldroid shall consist of a BeagleBone Black, a Linux OS Board, or a 32-Bit ARM board. 
					</p>
					<p>Alternatively, there are multiple solutions for this subsystem. Instead of a single board computer, we can choose to integrate a real-time controller. Real-time controllers allow us to make real-time corrections to our system. In particular, we can make the robot extremely responsive to its changes thus significantly increasing its level of accuracy and precision well beyond the capabilities of a human. Although real-time controllers can provide a strong and extremely reliable solution to our problem, the high cost of these devices is an important consideration if pursuing this solution.
					</p>
					<h2>Operating System</h2>
					<p>For this subsystem, the decisions from Major System-Level Trade A and Subsystem B had to be taken into account. Note, that for our project we chose hardware components first and then proceeded to choose an operating system that supports our hardware. Furthermore, given our chosen operating system, we have multiple options to explore for firmware. 
					</p>
					<p>For this subsystem trade, we decided to choose an operating system that is fast, allows for a wide programming freedom, and features good community support for hardware components. Having an OS that efficiently performs its tasks allows us to achieve our overarching objective in a timely manner. Furthermore, a stable and reliable OS adds to the robustness of our system making it more user friendly. Based on these 3 main factors, several distributions in Linux OS can provide us with the tools we need. The distributions in question are Ubuntu 14.04, Xubuntu 14.04, and Arch Linux. These options allow us to program in any programming language and have strong capabilities and features for robotic applications. 
					</p>
					<p>Alternatively, we could choose to deploy an operating system that is driven by convenience for the user rather than operational performance. This might also restrict our programming freedom to fewer options.
					</p>
					<h2>Drive System</h2>
					<p>For overall robot system stability it is desirable to have a robust drive system. It will significantly affect the time required for task completion which is one of the most important non-functional requirements for Fieldroid. Also, it is essential to have an easily maneuverable system to be able to paint intricate designs on a field.
					</p>
					<p>Following the trade study, a three wheeled Fieldroid, is the most appropriate drive system. A three wheeled drive system will provide better stability which is required for the system to be able to hold the weight of the overall paint system, and simultaneously navigate a field of grass.
					</p>
					<h2>Paint System</h2>
					<p>Selection of an effective paint system is important. Current field painting operations performed by manual labor are accurate but time consuming, so it is important for our system to paint accurately and quickly. Also, it is an important subsystem which determines the overall reliability of Fieldroid.
					</p>
					<p>The critical attributes contributing to a working system include the type of pump used to deploy paint and the type of spray mechanism.  From the trade study, it is observed that the second best option is using a Diaphragm pump based mechanism. Aerosol sprays are convenient and fast, but when painting large fields they can accumulate significant costs. For autonomous Fieldroid operation it is required that there is sufficient paint storage on board. Aerosol cans are small and their paint capacity is much less than the typical pump system.  
					</p>
					<h2>Control Systems</h2>
					<p>Fieldroid must utilize effective control systems in order to achieve our stated performance requirements for efficiency and precision. The onboard CPU will integrate our sensing systems (localization, resource monitoring) with our actuation systems (driving, painting) in order form a negative feedback loop and effectively optimize Fieldroidâ€™s performance. 
					</p>
					<p>The most critical control loops included on Fieldroid will support autonomous navigation and painting. The drive system will feature PID controls which link localization information directly to motor speed. This feature is critical for smooth and accurate motion. Additionally, the paint system will regulate the amount of paint being dispensed based on information received from the drive system and localization system. This will result in the efficient use of paint and consistent painting performance. All of these control loops will be managed by Fieldroidâ€™s onboard CPU.
					</p>
					<h2>User Interface</h2>
					<p>Communication with the Fieldroid system must be facilitated by a user interface (UI). This UI must be simple and intuitive so that the user can quickly send commands to the system. An easy to read interface will also allow the user to monitor Fieldroidâ€™s current status and alert the user of any problems such as a low battery, low supply of paint, or a blocked path. 
					</p>
					<p>As a result of Subsystem Trade F, we will be creating a mobile application available for download by the user. This type of UI takes advantage of a userâ€™s existing device and completely eliminates expenses such as interactive monitors. Mobile devices are constantly accessible and convenient to monitor if the user is away from the Fieldroid. Having a UI which is physically detached from the Fieldroid keeps the user dirt and paint free.
