						<p style="margin-left:160px;"><a href="http://stephenmitchellsmith.me/">Stephen</a> has had numerous experiences developing robotics applications for research and industry. His systems design focus has provided him with the ability to seek experience in a multitude of fields including Mechanical Design at Cisco Systems, Electrical Engineering at Newport News Shipbuilding, and several computer engineering and controls research positions at Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon (CMU). The kinematic behavioral control work he developed at CMU is most notable as it incorporated work on autonomous sixteen degree-of-freedom snake robots that were able to complete realistic tasks. With his systems approach to technical positions, Stephen has developed strong working knowledge in many complicated engineering fields. On top of these positions, he has also founded his own company, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2013/07/jar-with-a-twist-billed-as-end-to-peanut-butter-knuckles/">Jar~with~a~Twist</a> a new solution to peanut butter jars. Running this company, he has developed significant experiences in marketing, sales, and financial analysis. These abilities are what clearly sets him apart as an business thinking systems engineer who his pursuing his Masters of Science in Robotics Systems Design at Carnegie Mellon University.
