					<p>A beautiful and meticulously painted field is the pride of every major soccer and football team in the world. It is an enormous spectacle which requires constant care and maintenance. Currently, this maintenance implies several laborers spending many painstaking hours in an effort to paint across more than an acre of grass every week. <b>The Fieldroid is an autonomous field painting system that will transform any field of grass into a professional grade sports stadium!</b></p>
					<div align="center"><img src="http://i.giflike.com/0S1PBzp.gif" style="width:600px;" alt="Fieldroid in motion"/></div> 
					<p>Affordable and easy-to-use, fieldroid will bring field quality to the next level for all sports organizations, big and small. Giving everyone the ability to play on a professional field, this robot will inspire the next generation of sports stars!</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t10N30T.jpg" style="width:1000px;" alt="Complicated field painting designs" /><br />Field painting can be extremely complex </p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/poe/2008/1008/images/DowdyFieldPrep2.jpg" style="width:1000px;" alt="Complicated field painting designs" /><br />Field painting needs coordination</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/04/article-2096099-119606E8000005DC-575_634x420.jpg" style="width:1000px;" alt="Complicated field painting designs" /><br />Field painting can happen at any time</p>
					<p>While current solutions are time, labor and resource intensive, Fieldroid paints field markings, text, and graphics with superhuman precision and efficiency. The excessive use of paint is an unnecessary cost which damages grassy fields. Fieldroid can control the amount of paint used at any point on the field so that it limits these damages, all while saving paint. Furthermore, time is money in the fast paced sports industry. One field may have to be repainted more than once in a single day to accommodate multiple events. Fieldroid paints a field in under two hours allowing for faster turnover times between events. It also operates at all times of day or night so that field managers have one less thing to worry about when they wake up. We present advanced technologies in the form of an easy to use robot so that the only simple step between a plot of grass and a professional grade sports field is Fieldroid.</p>

					<p>Bob Corley has had a long day. The first big game of the season is tomorrow, Steelers vs The Cowboys at home. Bob is the groundskeeper for The Heinz Stadium which is considered one of the most beautiful Football fields in the nation. His team has been hard at work all day making sure the field is in perfect condition. They spend much of the day making the final touches to the turf before they could let the Fieldroid loose.</p>
					<p>At about 3pm, Bob was able to give the okay on the turf and he let his project manager, sErica, get the robot out of the storage facility and start it up for the first round of paint. She takes it out to the corner of the field, pulls out her phone, and starts tapping the screen. Bob knew very well the interface she was messing with, it was a well-designed app in which she could pull up a pre-programmed line set for a standard NFL field. Bob asks if she had charged Fieldroid since the last use and she stated the battery was at 100%. He grabbed the paint from the storage area and poured it into the cartridge on the robot. For the lines, he knew the robot would only need white and due to its efficient use of paint, he only needed to fill it once for the whole field. Erica double checked the paint and the settings on the phone. She set up the survey beacon and tapped the calibrate button on the App. The Fieldroid was waiting for the okay to start.</p>
					<p>Bob was always amazed at the reliability of this complex system. The stadium had owned this system for over 2 years and had very few issues. They were one of the first adopters of this technology, and he knew that could have meant real problems.</p>
					<p>Erica checked with Bob to make sure everything looked good and she tapped the launch button on her phone. Off the robot went, painting the outline, the cross lines, and then the numbers. It was a tedious task that would normally take his team half a day. The robot would be done in a little over an hour.</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, Bob came back to find the robot waiting for its next command, having finished the lines on the field. This next part was Bob's favorite part about this product, but sadly he had to get home to have dinner with his family. The battery still reading over 70%, had plenty left to finish the job. He pulled out the white cartridge and placed in a color one that he filled up with gold and black. He placed the robot on the corner of the field, just like before and tapped the launch key on his phone. This time, he had input the logo design for the center of the field and end zones. He would stick around and watch, but it was getting dark and he really wanted to see his kids before the big game tomorrow.</p>
					<p>As he left the stadium, he turned off the lights and wandered out to his car. The robot was still going, as it would take a few hours to complete, but he knew how they used to do it in the old days, another half day of work - just for the logos. Bob remembered the Fieldroid's marketing tactic of "set it and leave it alone." Boy was he happy he made that purchase as he knew full well he could show up in the morning with a perfectly painted field and a robot, The Fieldroid, sitting in the corner waiting to be charged for the next big event.</p>
